### Project Ojective
---

This KPI report monitors Occupational Health & Safety metrics to ensure compliance and improve safety performance. Non-compliances are identified against targets, while areas of good performance are recognized and celebrated..

This project showcases efficient collaboration by collecting and standardizing data from multiple team members through centralized platforms, making it ready for analysis


### Dataset Information
---

This dataset comprises manually entered data from multiple team members sourced from various systems recording HSE KPIs. The user-friendly Excel tables are then loaded into Power BI for analysis. Dimension tables are manually developed, transformed, and modeled alongside fact tables in Power BI, incorporating necessary calculations through measures and calculated table.


### Project Approach
---

To achieve the project objective, the following data collection and Power BI report development steps were followed....

**1. Data Collection:**
Data input tables were created in a Microsoft Teams private channel and these were synced to the One Drive for Business, making it easier for users to access on their desktops. Only team members in charge of reporting for their respective divisions were granted access to control data input integrity.

**2. Data Extraction:**
The fact and dimension input tables with continuously generated data were loaded into Power BI, ready for transformation.

**3. Data Transformation:**
Transforming data involves converting it to the desired data types and addressing human errors, including actions like trimming, correcting text types, fixing misspelled words, and handling missing data.  

**4. Data Modeling:**
The transformed data was ready for creation of relationships(modeling) and a date table was hardcoded into the Power BI report.

**5. Power BI report development:**
Power BI report development with continuous engagements of the Occupational Health & Safety team, based on what they would like to observe on the report.
